        <br> <br><h2> <em> <u> THE AVENGERS- MARVEL SERIES </u> </em> </h2> <br>
        <p>
            The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. Since 2008, Marvel Studios has released 23 films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from Iron Man (2008) to Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and three television series since 2021. A victory lap that moonwalks through the best part of the MCU back catalogue and emphasises emotion as much as action, this is an intensely satisfying piece of blockbuster filmmaking.
